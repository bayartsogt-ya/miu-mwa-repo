/**
 * Exercise 03
 * Write an asynchronous Node program that has a function checkSystem() that checks 
 * if the system memory size is at least 4 GB and the processor has more than 2 cores (use os core module).
 * 
 * When you call the function, you should receive an immediate message on the console Checking your systemâ€¦
 * If the system doesn't have enough memory we should print a message to the console: This app needs at least 4 GB of RAM
 * If the system doesn't have at least 2 cores, print this message to the console: Processor is not supported
 * If the system has enough specs, print the following message System is checked successfully.
